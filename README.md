# DSA-MINOR_PROJECT
This Java program implements a membership database system for clubs, allowing efficient management of member records. The system consists of three main classes: Member, Date, and Main.

Member Class: This class represents a club member and encapsulates member attributes such as ID, name, handicap, gender, team, member type, coach, phone number, and join date. It provides methods to set and retrieve member details, as well as a display method to showcase member information.

Date Class: The Date class defines a custom date object to manage date-related functionalities within the system. It includes attributes for day, month, and year, along with methods to compare dates and convert month names to numbers.

Main Class: The Main class serves as the entry point for the program and orchestrates database operations. It initializes an array of Member objects with sample data and demonstrates various functionalities, including displaying all members, filtering records based on specific criteria (such as join date, handicap, and team), and presenting the results.

The program is designed to showcase object-oriented programming principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. It demonstrates the effective use of data structures and algorithms to manage member data efficiently. Overall, this membership database system provides a versatile and user-friendly solution for clubs seeking to streamline their membership management processes.
